Sprint 5
7/21/2015

NOTE: We suppressed some issues in the Global Suppresions file. We hope this will make it easier to read. The suppresed ones are the Default Parameter
      issues which Prof. Boggus said were okay and the errors that are excused because of XNA.

CODE ANALYSIS ISSUES:
	CA1502 - The branching makes the CollisionDetector very flexible. We didn't make time to simplify.
	CA1044 - Our design makes it important that things such as CollisionDetector have access to Core.
