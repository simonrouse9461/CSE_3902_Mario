This class is used to handle all state changes for all kinds of block objects.
So, the cohesion of the class is very high. However, since many kinds of 
block object are all sharing one StateController, the coupling of the class
can be considered high. In this way, the state of all kinds of blocks need 
to have the same contract in order to make them all work with this state 
controller. Once a single block need some special feature to make it's contract
slightly different from other blocks, contract of every block need to be changed
to keep all blocks work.

I recommend to seperate this state controller for individual blocks, so coupling
will be lower.
