Code Quality:
Code has high cohesion and low cyclomatic complexity. Number of lines is on the higher side
but not excessive. Class does use SpriteState frequently but it is expected for a state
controller. Because of the granular nature of the methods etc. in this class, changes or 
additions would be very simple if more block types or items spawning from blocks were added.
Overall, while not the most complex class, it is well implemented and has high code quality.
