Comment:
	The cohesion of the code is very high. All the Enums, Properties, and methods
are about how does the green pipe appear on the game canvas. No other unrelated
information, such as location and movement, is included.
	The coupling of the code is not low enough, since local properties, namely the
state of the pipe, can only be changed by the directly access from another class.

Possible change:
	Methods that change the state of the pipe can be added and local properties
can be made private, in order to decrease coupling.
