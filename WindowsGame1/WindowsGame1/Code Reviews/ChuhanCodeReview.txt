The cohesion of the code is very high. All the Enums, Properties, and methods
are about how does the green pipe appear on the game canvas. No other unrelated
information, such as location and movement, is included.
The coupling of the code is low, since the sprite sheet is implemeted in another
class. Each implementation can be changed without changing both of them.
