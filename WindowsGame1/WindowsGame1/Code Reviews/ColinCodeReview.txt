Comments:
	Code is very readable, variable names are informative, 
	Methods are easy to implement for all types of objects 
	making it very reusible. Exhibits a high cohesion and low 
	coupling style. Exhibits no common code smells.
Possible change:
	We have discussed tracking object/sprite position by using
	the midpoint of the sides of their rectangles. This would 
	allow removal of the width and height properties and involve
	slightly different parameters for the SpriteSource method.
	Overall the maintanability is high for this struct.
