Comments:
	The cohesion is really high since all the object are game 
	contents which are similar functionally.So it is easy to 
	maintain if any change in the game world is needed.At the
	same time, variable names are clear and easy to understand 
	when being read with codes.

Future changes:
	The coupling is not low enough since many objects are call 
	for multiple times in different functions. However, at this 
	point tight coupling is neccessary since these objects need 
	to be created in the game world by each functions.
