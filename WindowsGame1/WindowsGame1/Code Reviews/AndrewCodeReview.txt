Comments:

	ObjectKernelNew is a replacement class for the previous 
	implementation of ObjectKernel. The new class aims to 
	streamline the decisionmaking for switching between 
	sprites, since the previous implementation did not account
	for more than one type of sprite on the screen at the same 
	time. Cohesion is very high since all of the methods in the
	class are related; the entire class is made of methods to 
	choose the appropriate sprites for certain actions or 
	game states. It also contains a reset method in case a sprite 
	needs to be reset at any time. This class is what is used to 
	create the individual objects that then can be placed all over
	the game space.

Future changes:
	It is hard to think of anything that could be done to improve
	the class; this class makes it possible to draw and choose
	the sprites also based on the motion being conducted on the
	sprite. Possibly overriding an unload method in order to 
	be able to changes levels in case there is a problem with
	using the main game file for the unloading.
