Sprint 2

File: MarioSpriteState.cs

Time: 4 minutes

COMMENTS:
	Readability is sacrificed with the use of a list to hold sprites. For example, the BigLeftFacingMario sprite is
		SpriteList[7]. SpriteList[7] as a "indentifier" isn't clear.
	Also, the 4 switch cases withing a switch case is a bit complex and this hurts readability.
	Other than that, readability is good. Good variables names and concise code.
