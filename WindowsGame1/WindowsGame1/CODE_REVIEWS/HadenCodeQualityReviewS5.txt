File Author: Andrew Miller
Time: 8 minutes

CODE REVIEW:
		I think the BlockStateController is fairly readable. I am a bit confused by it though. I am confused that there are both hasItem methods
	and giveItem methods which can be chosen. What I mean is, at first glance, it seems that one could call hasStar() which would make the block
	have a star than immediately call NormalBlockCoinHit(). This is not very cohesive.
		In QuestionBlockObject I am also confused that there are various methods that all return a new instance of 'this'. I wouldn't think that 
	a new QuestionBlockObject should be constructed to return a different item. I would think that the state controller could just be changed.
		Other than that I think code quality is good. Coupling is pretty low. Code is fairly short and simple.

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE:
		If several new block types were added the BlockStateController could get fairly long.
