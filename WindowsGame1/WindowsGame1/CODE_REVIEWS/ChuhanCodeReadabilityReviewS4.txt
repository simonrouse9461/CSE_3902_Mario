Comment:
	Declare all status of a hidden block and method to modify
	it. So these code are in high cohesion which makes the maintainess
	of hidden block easier. The coupling is not low but is not avoidable,
	which is not neccesary to change the code to make it lower.

Future possible changes:
	The apper status is included in the UsedBlock status. It
	might need to be split from the UsedBlock enum in the future.
