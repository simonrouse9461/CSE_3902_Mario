Comment:
	Declaration and method override are seperated, so the structure
	of the code is clear. The Handle() method includes all the collision
	case need to be handle, so it is high cohesion. At the same time,
	all the if statements are separated, which makes the coupling low 	
	enough.

Future possible changes:
	There two cases handling Mario, it is possible to refactor it to get 
	all Mario related case together. Then it will easy to target when Mario 
	related stuff need to be changed.
