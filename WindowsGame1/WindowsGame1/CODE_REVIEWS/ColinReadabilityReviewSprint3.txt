Comments: Naming is very descriptive, makes the purpose of the class
very clear. Enemy states are only changed when the enemy detects a 
collision with Mario from the top. Goomba object is unloaded so that
disappears, possibly only issue to be refactored is the magic number 
passed to the unload method, not totally clear what this does/means.
Overall the class is very readable.
