Comment:
	File name is clear enough to show what it does. The Enum is
clearly defined to show different state of the block. The purpose
of all fields, properties, functions can be clearly identified
by their names. The overall readability is high.

Comment:
	File name explains itself. This class is used to handle the collision
	for hidden block. For the private field inside the class, the purpose
	is very obvious to see from its name. For the field which named
	MarioHiddenBlockCollision, I understand it is a collision detector for
	the collision between mario and hidden block, but what makes me a little
	confused is that the name sounds like mario is detecting hidden block
	rather than hidden block is detecting mario. So the problem it causes
	appears in Handle() method, when it says:
	"if (MarioHiddenBlockCollision.Detect().Bottom)"
	What I immediately come up with is that hidden block is at the bottom
	of Mario, but actually it just means the reverse. Consequently, this
	not only makes the reader confused, but also confuses the author about
	his logic. So if I were him, I'll name it HiddenBlockMarioCollision,
	which makes hidden block sounds like the subject of the detect action.
	Other than that, everything is easy to understand.

Comment:
	Declare all status of a hidden block and method to modify
	it. So these code are in high cohesion which makes the maintainess
	of hidden block easier. The coupling is not low but is not avoidable,
	which is not neccesary to change the code to make it lower.

Future possible changes:
	The apper status is included in the UsedBlock status. It
	might need to be split from the UsedBlock enum in the future.
