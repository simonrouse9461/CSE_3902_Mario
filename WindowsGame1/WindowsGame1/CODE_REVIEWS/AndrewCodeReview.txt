This class is designed to detail how the Goombas move throughout the world and how to react when they
are presented with certain obstacles such as blocks, pipes, and Mario, as well as how to react when they
walk off a ledge or a cliff. Each of the methods are descriptive and easily detail what action is being
performed. There also seems to be more depth to the "motions", as there are modifiers like EnemyVelocity
that may change the way the motion behaves depending on the type of object. There are not many, if any, 
improvements to be made in this class since all the methods handle each of the movements and the cases
that the Goomba will encounter while the game is running. The class is also fairly short, and nesting
is minimal; the only nesting done is to perform specific checks to then decide what to do next.
