Time: 10 minutes

This class is meant to define the motions that the objects can go through that have the capability of bouncing up and down -
namely, Mario, fireballs and blocks. There are several different versions of this bounce up motion that can be seen in 
the enum of the class. All of the enum's versions are very clear about what they do; MarioDieVersion is related to the 
motion of Mario dying, FireballBounceVersion is related to the bouncing motion of the Fireball, and so on. Each motion has
it's own vectors, so that the BounceUpMotion can be defined independently for each specific need. This allows for easy
maintenance of the objects that utilize this class. Since the method names are very descriptive for their uses, it is simple
to figure out what each one does and it will be very easy to maintain this code since there are a variety of uses of this class.
