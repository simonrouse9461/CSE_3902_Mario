This class is designed to change the sprites and animations of Mario depending on his interactions
in the game world. The constructor adds all the sprites and animations, and all the following
methods are what change the sprites. Most methods are descriptively named, so it is easy to understand
what each of the methods do, however there are a few that are slightly confusing to figure out what
they do only by looking at the names. For example, the Upgrading() method's name is slightly ambiguous,
but when the contents of the method is looked at, the purpose of the method is fairly clear. When this
method is called, Mario will "upgrade" himself, so it is possibly called when Mario interacts with a 
Mushroom or Fireflower. The rest of the methods are clear in their names and uses, and nesting is
kept to a minimum. If there are multiple cases, they are split up into different methods altogether and
tested separately.

This is not much that can be done to improve this class, since most of the methods are at most a few lines
each, so it is not possible to cut down the size further. Nesting is avoided by breaking down methods into
more methods, so it is easier to maintain the code in the long run. Only one or two methods could be 
renamed to give them slightly clearer meaning, but the contents of these methods make the purpose of them
clear as well.
