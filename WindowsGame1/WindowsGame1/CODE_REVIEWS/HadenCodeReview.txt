COMMENTS:
		Naturally, this class has significant coupling. I think all coupling is necessary. 
		Cohesion is fairly high. The code serves the purpose of adding and removing world 
	objects. At first I thought it might be more cohesive to separate the level loader from 
	the other world management logic such as removing and adding objects. However, see 
	"hypothetical change" for a possible advantage of the current design. 
		Also, I am a bit confused by the FindObjectCollectionList and FindObjectCollection 
	methods. Based on the name, I would think that FindObjectCollectionList would basically 
	just return ObjectList (since ObjectList is in some sense a list of collections) but that 
	doesn't seem to be what it is doing. Other readers may have similar confusion, so I'd
	consider renaming.

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE:
		If a new type was added, it would change the code in two locations: the initialization 
	of ObjectList and the LoadContent method which process the XML. This is a possible advantage 
	to having the load XML logic and the world maintenance logic in the same class. (Both places
	where you'd have to change something are in the same file.) I think the file is very 
	maintainable.
