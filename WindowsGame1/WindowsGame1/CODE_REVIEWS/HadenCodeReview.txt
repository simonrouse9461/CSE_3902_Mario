File: CollisionDetectorNew.cs
File Author: Chuhan Feng
Time: 10 minutes

COMMENTS:
		CollisionDetectorNew is incredibly complex. It takes far too much effort to read and understand. (I am sure a grader will not want
	to take that much time either.) While I have not taken the time to understand the details of it, here are some comments:
	
		- Inlay and Cover do not seem to be good names because I don't know what they mean.
		- It might help to make private static methods to use in the inner nesting to make it more readable.

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE:
		I do think it is pretty durable to change - it takes lots of different kinds of collision into account.
