READABILITY REVIEW:
		File is very readable. My only ideas to improve readability are that maybe
	naming could be changed to make the purpose of methods more clear. For example,
	hasStar() might be assumed to be a method that will return whether or not the
	block has a star. In actuality, it tells the object that it has a star (if I am
	not mistaken). Maybe "giveStarToBlock()" or something similar would be more 
	clear.
