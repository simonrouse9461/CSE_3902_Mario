Comment:
	The cohesion of this class is very high, since everything in this class
	is about handling Koopa's collision with another object. However the coupling
	of this class is not low enough. In the implementation of Handle() method, 
	all differnet kinds of collision handling are mixing together which makes the
	method relatively long and the structure is not clear enough and hard to read.
	So if the KoopaCollisionHandler will have a subclass or a decorator class,
	then the whole Handle() method need to be overridden rather than part of it, 
	which means its subclass has nothing to inherite from it. This may cause 
	duplicated logic and losing single point control when using subclass or
	decorator pattern.

Future possible changes:
	The big Handle() method can be splited into several small methods, each of
	which handles one specific kind of collision, and those small methods can be
	made virtual to allow overriding.
