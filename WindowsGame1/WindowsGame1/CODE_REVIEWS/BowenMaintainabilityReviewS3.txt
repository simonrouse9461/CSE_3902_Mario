Sprint #: 3
File: CollisionType.cs
File Author: Chuhan Feng
Time: 3 minutes

COMMENTS:
	Code was written in high cohesion which will make maintainess easier.
	If any new collision condition is needed, we could just add some new 
	thing in this file. Low coupling since everything been used is created
	in this file.

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE:
	CollisonType was build in to a struct instead of a class, which may 	
	cause some potential problems.
