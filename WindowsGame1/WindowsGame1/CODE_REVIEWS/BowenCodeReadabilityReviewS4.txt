COMMENTS:
Code was written in high cohesion which will make maintainess easier.
If any new collision condition is needed, we could just add some new 
thing in this file. Low coupling since everything been used is created
in this file.

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE:
CollisonType was build in to a struct instead of a class, which may
cause some potential problems.
