Code Quality:
	All the camera related methods is in here. It looks a little 
	complicated at first, but since all camera related method and 
	properties is in this class. It is not hard to understand after
	look through the whole code.
	At the same time, it is no doubt that this class is high cohesion.
	So if the camera need any adjustment, we could just change the 
	rectangle and update() method.
	Though all method used variables like location, which means high
	coupling, these code are not avoidable.
