COMMENTS:
	Code modified all the changes needed for a Mario taking damage.
	It focus on the condition that Mario taking damage, so it is high 
	cohesion. Each changes of Core is not related to each other, which 
	means the coupling is low and changes wonâ€™t affect each other.

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE:
	HandleStar is not quit fit in to this code since it deal with the enemy 
	problem. So though it is not hard to understand but it could have better
	place to put in to.
