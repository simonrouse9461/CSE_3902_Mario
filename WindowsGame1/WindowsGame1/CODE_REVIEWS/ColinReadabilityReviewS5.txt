Comments: While this class is on the long side, the short, one line methods are easy to 
understand and the methods make sense to group together. Inheritence is clear aside from the 
blockMotionState. It doesn't appear to be used in the class. This class handles all versions 
of blocks but it does so in a very simple way, descriptive names make the functions very
clear and easy to implement if needed.
