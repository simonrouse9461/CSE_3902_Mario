CODE REVIEW:
	Compare to the old object kernel the new one increased the cohesion
and decreased the coupling. It make all the prorperties of an object 
saperate from each other and have an Core concept to access all of these
properties. This change list out all the possible properties, and split 
modifications on sprites, barrier and commands in to different functions 
which make the object kernel more powerful when people want to change any 
properties in the future.
