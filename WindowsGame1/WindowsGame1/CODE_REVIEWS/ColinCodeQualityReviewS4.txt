Code Quality:
This class has very little cyclomatic complexity, and high cohesion. All
methods pertain to changing a Goomba's motion. While there is some coupling 
with IMotion, it is used to reduce duplicate code and coupling is not overly
high. The class is on the longer side at 103 lines of code but certainly
not excessive. Many of these methods could be reused for other enemies if needed
making the code very flexible.
