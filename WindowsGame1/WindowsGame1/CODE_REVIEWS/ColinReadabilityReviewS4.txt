Comments: Variable names are descriptive. Collection of Status switches is sensible and
very readable. RefreshMotionState updates the various components of a Goomba's possible
motion based on what motion is selected. Methods to get goomba to turn if it runs into
an object and to crush goomba are very understandable and sensible to have. Overall the 
function and purpose of this class and its components are very easy to understand and 
modify if needed.
