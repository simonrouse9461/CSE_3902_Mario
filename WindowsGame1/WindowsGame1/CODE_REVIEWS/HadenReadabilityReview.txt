File: WorldManager.cs

Time: 10 minutes

COMMENTS:
		Overall I would say readability is decent. This might be lack of knowledge on my part, but I don't understand why the WorldManager
	calls its own constructor. Naming could probably be improved a bit. "ObjectCollectionList" is a bit ambiguous. Is that a list of all
	the different types (collections) or objects? I'm not sure by the name. Also, I don't know why the find object method is there. It 
	seem like the WorldManager would need to pick specific items or remove them. 
		Finally, this would take more refactoring, but I feel like maybe we should just call load once for each class that needs the content
	manager. Because the class would just need to load the texture once right? The texture could be a static field. This would be significant
	refactoring. Not quite sure it would work yet.
