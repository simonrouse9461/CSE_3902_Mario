Comments: Variable names is using some short cuts. It made the 
	  code hard to read at first but the short cut is not
	  hard to understand and make the whole file more clear.
	  The structure of Display is close to the class WorldManager.
	  It help reading the code. Method is in high cohesion 
 	  naming and function. The only other thing may be confused
 	  at first is the instance variable, but this tempoaray 
	  variable is necessary in this class.
