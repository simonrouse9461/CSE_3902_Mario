COMMENTS:
		This abstract class does provide a decent amount of implementation which
		helps reduce duplicate code elsewhere. Many of the methods would not need to change
		if new items were added to MotionList for example making it maintanable if we
		need to add motion types. The methods that dont provide implementation are commented
		well and make sense to not include in this class. Overall, the class takes care of 
		what it needs to which means its not highly coupled or overly long and easy to 
		expand upon.

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE:
		Even a large change such as making our game into a space shooter would be fairly easy
		because most of the methods are generic in regards to directions and uses. This class
		would change very little for some fairly large changes to our game as a whole.
