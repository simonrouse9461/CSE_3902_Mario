Sprint 2

File: ObjectKernelNew.cs
File Author: Chuhan Feng
Time: 8 minutes

COMMENTS:
	Readability is high, due to the use of mostly method calls and not many parameters. 
	However, there appear to be methods with no real purpose implemented quite yet.
	The GetLocation() method makes a call to the ObjectNew interface, but it is not
	used anywhere else. It is unclear what this method will do at the current time since
	there is no need for an implementation for it just yet. If it is a method for testing
	where a sprite is currently on the screen, then it can clearly be used for collision
	detection later on, but the current implementation of the method is unclear. The
	Reset() method falls into the same category, but due to the name it is expected that
	this method will be used to possibly reset sprites to a default state when used. The 
	rest is easy to read since the remaining methods are related to sprite functionality
	for the program.
