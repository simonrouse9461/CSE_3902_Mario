COMMENTS:
	I find this fairly difficult to read. I might be misunderstanding how the class works.
	
	I think it would be useful to either rename "Phase" or "phase". I think these names are too similar. 
	
	I do not think "Phase" and "Cycle" are very descriptive names. I might recommend "currentCount" and 
	"countsInCycle".

	If I understand correctly, every time the Update method is called, the currentCount is incremented
	and the methods returns whether or not the currentCount has reached the countsInCycle. I think it
	might be best to separate this into two methods:
		1. void Increment()
		2. bool CycleComplete()
	I see how this might cause problems (with user having to call both of the methods). But I think 
	separating them would be better. 

	It also seems that currently Update has another use which should be separated into a different method.
	I am referring to the ability to change the currentCount via an argument (for example: "Update(8)"). I think this
	should be separated into another method such as:
		3. void ChangeCurrentCounterValue(int newCountValue)
