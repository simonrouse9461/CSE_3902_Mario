CODE ANALYSIS ISSUES:
	CA1026 - Default parameters have helped make code simpler. Consulted Prof. Boggus.
	CA1014 - We can't seem to fix this.
	CA1502 - CollisionDetectorNew and MarioSpriteState are excessively complex. We didn't have time to refactor.
	CA2225 - ???????
	CA1823 - graphics is not unused.
	CA1004 - AddBarrier makes all objects of a certain type a barrier for the object. We think this is the best way to pass a type.
				Similar for FindMotion
	CA2227, CA1001, CA1002, CA1006, CA1024  - We didn't have time to refactor.
	CA1802 - Non-issue.
